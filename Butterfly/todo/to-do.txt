Custom JTable (need to be able to highlight currently playing song, store Song object in the row, change border color,
	       double click won't edit strings)
File menu (which should include directory)
Ability to set custom folders to load from, as well as saving that list to a bfd file
Logout from twitter
Change colors of jtree using custom treenode
exit program
show songlength on table
update song time when dragging bar
when clearing queue, handle nullpointerexception

QA the shit out of it
change artist does not change artist for song?
